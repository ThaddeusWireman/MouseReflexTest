# MouseReflexTest is a program that I have slowly been creating for my first Python course in college.
# The program utilizes the tkinter package to randomly generate target buttons on the game screen that the
# user clicks as quickly as they can for 30 seconds. The total score and average time-per-target is displayed
# when the 30 seconds are up. The game asks the user for their username, asks if you would like to play in normal or hard
# mode, and then starts the game. The hard mode shows significantly smaller buttons.
